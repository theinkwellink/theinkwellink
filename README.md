Adventures in writing.
</p>

I have been keeping this secret for long enough. I am a writer. Stories, discoveries, events, even thoughts about bugs, I write about them. It is time someone knows about it. 

Titles of things:

Coffee and Bananas 

77 Cents for a Carton of Eggs

Odessa Cycles

National Creative Control Discovery Day

Finally.

The Lucky Duckling
